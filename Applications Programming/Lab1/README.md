# Lab 1 â€“ Disaster Response Simulation  

This project was created for **Applications Programming** at UT San Antonio. It models emergency response units (ships, helicopters, and ground vehicles) and simulates navigation, aid deployment, and passenger services.  

## Highlights  
- Uses **Java OOP principles**: interfaces, abstract classes, inheritance, and polymorphism.  
- Implements multiple responder types:  
  - `AidShip`, `PassengerShip`, `RescueHelicopter`, `MobileClinicTruck`  
- Includes a **coordinator** that deploys all units and prints readiness reports.  

## How to Run  
1. Open the project folder in IntelliJ (`Lab1`).  
2. Compile and run `Lab1.java`.  
3. Observe simulation output in the console.
